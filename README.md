## Project Overview

Algorithmic trading is crucial for financial markets.It improves market liquidity (via market making strategies) and reduces the bid-ask spread (via high-frequency trading). In other words, algorithmic trading makes it easy to buy and to sell at a better price. It also enhances market efficiency by quickly exploiting misprising (arbitrage strategies) and reduces the trading costs.Broadly, trading strategies could be categorized into technical and fundamental types of strategies. The most prominent categories, in most general terms, that fall into the class of technical analysis [1,2] are (a) trend following, and momentum, (b) mean reversion and statistical arbitrage, (c) high-frequency trading and market making. The most prominent categories that belong to the class of fundamental analysis [3,4] are (d) value investing usually done by analysing earning reports, (e) macro trading accounts for economic indicators, interest rates, geopolitical events, (f) sentiment-based rely on news and social media sentiment.

This project provides the students with unique opportunities to learn more about state-of-the-art algorithmic trading strategies and implement and test the strategies on real markets. Two types of markets will be considered as part of this project: Cryptocurrency market and Equity market.

## Project Objectives
##### Educational Opportunity: 
Provide students with a comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art algorithmic trading strategies in both cryptocurrency and equity markets.

##### Implementation and Testing: 
Enable students to implement and test various algorithmic trading strategies on real market data, allowing them to gain practical experience in algorithmic trading.

##### Market Analysis Skills: 
Develop students' abilities to analyze market dynamics, including liquidity, bid-ask spread, market efficiency, and the impact of algorithmic trading on these factors.

##### Strategy Categorization: 
Familiarize students with the broad categories of trading strategies, including technical analysis (such as trend following, mean reversion, and high-frequency trading) and fundamental analysis (such as value investing, macro trading, and sentiment-based strategies).

##### Cross-Market Comparison: 
Encourage students to compare and contrast the effectiveness of different trading strategies across cryptocurrency and equity markets, highlighting the unique characteristics and challenges of each market.

##### Risk Management: 
Teach students the importance of risk management in algorithmic trading, including strategies to mitigate risks associated with market volatility, unexpected events, and algorithmic errors.

##### Ethical Considerations: 
Foster discussions on the ethical implications of algorithmic trading, including concerns related to market manipulation, information asymmetry, and fairness in market access.

##### Performance Evaluation: 
Equip students with the tools and methodologies to evaluate the performance of their trading strategies, considering metrics such as profitability, risk-adjusted returns, and drawdowns.
